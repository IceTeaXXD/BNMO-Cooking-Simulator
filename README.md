## About the Program
BNMO is a robot game owned by Indra and Doni. Lately, Indra has just had a special relationship with a woman named Siska Kol. And in the near future, Indra will invite Siska Kol to his house to have dinner together. Therefore, Indra asked BNMO and Doni to help prepare this special dinner. However, BNMO didn't know how to cook and Doni couldn't help with the preparations. BNMO cannot learn from youcub videos because BNMO is a computer so the easiest thing to do is to make a simulation program for BNMO to emulate. Therefore, Doni asks for your help to develop this simulation program.

Adventure Time.c is a CLI (Command Line Interface) based simulation program that we created using c language. The program includes many data structures as well as Abstract Data Types which we created ourselves. Some of them are Stack, Queue, Tree, and many more.
